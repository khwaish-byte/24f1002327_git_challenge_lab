# Time Series Load Forecasting of Household Energy Consumption

# Project Overview

This project aims to predict hourly household energy consumption using a machine learning model. By accurately forecasting energy usage, we can enable better energy management, optimize resource allocation, and support demand-side planning.

The core of this project is an XGBoost Regressor trained on a time-series dataset. The model leverages extensive feature engineering to capture seasonality, trends, and other temporal patterns, resulting in a low Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and demonstrating high predictive accuracy.

Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, XGBoost

Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Dataset

This project uses the "Individual household electric power consumption" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

Description: The dataset contains 2,075,259 measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years.

Key Columns: Global_active_power, Global_reactive_power, Voltage, Global_intensity, etc.

Project Workflow

The project is structured in a Jupyter Notebook and follows these key steps:

1. Data Preprocessing

Loaded the dataset, parsing the Date and Time columns into a single datetime index.

Handled missing values (common in this dataset) using appropriate imputation techniques (e.g., forward-fill or interpolation).

Resampled the one-minute data into hourly averages to make the forecasting task more manageable and relevant.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized the time series data to identify key patterns, including:

Overall trends (long-term changes in consumption).

Seasonality (annual, weekly, and daily cycles).

Outliers and anomalies in the data.

3. Feature Engineering

This was a critical step for model performance. The following features were created from the datetime index:

Calendar Features: hour_of_day, day_of_week, month, quarter, year.

Lag Features: Consumption data from previous time steps (e.g., 24 hours ago, 1 week ago) to capture auto-correlation.

Rolling Window Features: Rolling means (e.g., 7-day rolling average) to smooth out short-term fluctuations and capture trends.

4. Model Training & Evaluation

Model: An XGBoost Regressor was selected for its high performance in tabular and time-series-like datasets.

Train-Test Split: The data was split into training and testing sets chronologically to ensure the model was only trained on past data and tested on future data.

Evaluation: The model's performance was evaluated using standard regression metrics, primarily Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Results

The final XGBoost model performed exceptionally well, achieving a low Mean Absolute Error (MAE). This indicates a high level of accuracy in predicting the hourly energy consumption.

A plot of the predicted values versus the actual values on the test set shows the model's ability to capture the complex patterns of energy usage.
